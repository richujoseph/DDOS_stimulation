# DDoS Demonstration

## Overview
This project consists of a simple Netflix Clone hosted on a local server to demonstrate a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. The repository contains two main files: `app.py` and `rty.py`.

## Features
- **Localhost Netflix Clone** (`app.py`): A basic web application mimicking Netflix, used as a target for DDoS simulation.
- **DDoS Script** (`rty.py`): A Python script used to perform a DDoS attack on the local Netflix Clone.
- **Educational Purpose**: The project is designed for cybersecurity awareness and testing DDoS mitigation strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask for the web application)
- HTML, CSS (for the frontend design)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/richujoseph/DDOS_stimulation.git
   cd DDOS_stimulation
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Run the Netflix Clone server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Execute the DDoS script (`rty.py`) to simulate an attack:
   ```bash
   python rty.py
   ```
